Zsh Installation:
Zsh ships with OS X, however, it is an older version. I recommend installing the latest version using Homebrew, 
the Mac package manager.
To install zsh using Homebrew, enter the following into your terminal:
brew install zsh zsh-completions

Make zsh your systemâ€™s default shell:
chsh -s $(which zsh)

Verify that it worked:
echo $SHELL

expected result: /bin/zsh
